An Ex Libris Cloud App alternative to Alma's built-in print slip report.

This an attempt to make an Cloud App solution for the idea to [allow configuration of which columns are in the the Print Slip Report](https://ideas.exlibrisgroup.com/forums/308173-alma/suggestions/12375144-allow-configuration-of-which-columns-are-in-the-th) that was posted on Idea Exchange.

This app was developed as part of the [ANZREG](https://anzreg.igelu.org/) 2021 Cloud Apps hackathon.
